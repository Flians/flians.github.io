abstract: Superconducting rapid single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) logic has shown great potential
  for high-energy-efficient computing systems. To ensure correct operations at ultra-high
  frequencies, it is necessary to incorporate length-matching constraints into the
  routing problem. Existing routing algorithms, however, can only address 2-pin connections
  or support the conventional horizontal/vertical routing model, which substantially
  limits the optimization space for routing solutions. This paper presents JRouter,
  an RSFQ router that considers the two-layer planar Manhattan routing model while
  simultaneously coping with splitter (SPL) placement and length-matching multi-terminal
  routing. JRouter contains a track-assignment-based initial routing that minimizes
  the initial routing width while avoiding conflicts in the horizontal constraint
  graph. Moreover, JRouter implements an SPL-tree-based hierarchical routing with
  an iterative maximum-flow-based formulation to insert the detours for multi-terminal
  routing. A routing region extension algorithm is also developed to insert the detours
  for unsatisfied connections. According to the experimental results, JRouter achieves
  an average routing width reduction of 35.71% and 22.46% on a 16-bit RSFQ Sklansky
  adder compared to Kito's and Kou's routing algorithms. For randomly generated benchmarks,
  JRouter reduces the routing width by an average of 38.77%, 38.20%, 21.65%, and 7.01%
  compared to Kito's, Kou's, and two of Yan's routing algorithms, respectively, while
  maintaining reasonable runtime.
