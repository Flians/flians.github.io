  abstract = {Power and energy consumed by a high-performance computing system are a significant problem nowadays. Superconducting computing technology may offer an attractive low-power alternative to traditional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology due to the ultrafast and low power switching characteristics of superconductor devices. We offer a relatively comprehensive review of the latest development of superconducting computing technology from aspects of logic circuits, emerging superconducting architectures, and automated design tools. In light of the inner operation mechanisms, we classify the superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ) logic family into six major categories and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. Also, many novel superconducting architectures have been proposed, such as dual-clocks-based superconducting circuits, superconducting accelerators, and superconducting neuromorphic circuits. However, their effectiveness needs further evaluation, and their manufacturability is still unknown. Additional efforts are also demanded to enhance the electronic design automation of very large-scale integration (VLSI) SFQ circuits while maintaining a relatively low cost in area and power. We also discuss open challenges and future directions in the superconducting computing area of research.}
