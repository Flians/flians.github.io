  abstract  = {The potential of superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ) devices in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) has garnered significant attention due to their ultra-fast and low-power switching capabilities. However, existing SFQ-based DNN accelerators face limitations in scaling up to larger-scale instances due to the stringent area constraints and complex architectures. Additionally, another challenge in SFQ-based DNN acceleration lies in bridging the gap between the ultra-high computing speed offered by SFQ technology and the relatively low memory bandwidth. To address these challenges, we propose JBSA, an SFQ-based bit-serial accelerator for DNN inference acceleration. JBSA leverages bit-serial computing to alleviate area constraints and reduce bandwidth requirements. A bit-serial processing element is designed to implement multiply-accumulate operations using SFQ logic cells. Furthermore, we introduce a novel work distribution model that incorporates a data partitioning scheme and a corresponding scheduling strategy to enhance the overall efficiency of the accelerator. Experimental results show that JBSA surpasses the state-of-the-art SFQ-based DNN accelerator, achieving an 11\% performance improvement, a 2.3 \texttimes{} power efficiency improvement, and a 56\% Josephson junction count reduction. Compared to CMOS-based bit-serial DNN accelerators, JBSA also demonstrates outstanding performance and superior power efficiency.},
