abstract: Logic synthesis optimization is essential for enhancing the quality of results (QoR) of circuits by applying a sequence of structural transformations to circuit representations. 
This paper proposes RECALLS, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced generative model for logic synthesis optimization. RECALLS is built upon a graph-to-sequence generative model and further fine-tuned with RL from human feedback technology. This model eliminates repetitive exploration and directly generates sequences for any specified design by inference. 
Experimental results demonstrate that RECALLS significantly enhances circuit QoR compared to hand-crafted transformation sequences. Furthermore, RECALLS achieves thousands of times faster than the machine learning-based methods while consistently generating sequences with comparable QoR.
