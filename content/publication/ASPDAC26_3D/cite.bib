  abstract  = {Although 3D IC integration offers a promising path to alleviate interconnect bottlenecks in 2D designs, efficient 3D floorplanning remains challenging due to its increased spatial complexity. Prior approaches that directly extend 2D representations into 3D suffer from exponential solution spaces, while pre-partitioning strategies constrain the global optimization landscape by fixing block-to-die assignments early. As a result, both approaches not only hinder comprehensive exploration of the 3D design space, but also overlook critical 3D, specific characteristics such as inter-die communication latency, which directly impact system performance but are often abstracted away in simplified 2D-extended models. To address these challenges, we propose Great3D, a partitioning-free 3D floorplanning framework that jointly optimizes block floorplan and die assignment without relying on predefined die partitioning. By a two-stage 3D SDP optimization and 2D refinement, Great3D effectively minimizes wirelength and latency under outline constraints. Experimental results on GSRC benchmarks show that Great3D consistently achieves lower wirelength than the baselines, with up to 60\% reduction on large-scale designs. Furthermore, the method maintains competitive runtime performance while demonstrating better scalability and robustness across diverse benchmark sizes. These results establish Great3D as a scalable and effective partitioning-free solution for high-quality 3D IC floorplanning. },
