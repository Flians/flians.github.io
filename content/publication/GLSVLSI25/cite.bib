  abstract  = {Superconducting rapid single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) logic has garnered considerable attention as a prospective technology for future computing systems, thanks to its superior high-speed and low-power characteristics. However, conventional semiconductor logic synthesis tools can not guarantee the functional correctness of the generated RSFQ circuits. RSFQ circuits require DFF and splitter insertion to satisfy the path balancing requirement and the fanout limitation, thereby legitimizing the circuit design. Furthermore, DFFs and splitters inserted in RSFQ circuits introduce delays, occupy area, and substantially increase energy dissipation. To address this problem, this paper proposes an optimal DFF-oriented technology legalization algorithm. First, an integer linear programming algorithm is proposed for the logic level assignment to minimize the number of inserted DFFs. Then a splitter tree is constructed for each net of the circuit to minimize the timing discrepancies among the various fanouts. The experimental results on ISCAS’85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art, particularly with significant advantages on large circuits.},
