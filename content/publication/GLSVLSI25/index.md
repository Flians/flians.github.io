abstract: Superconducting rapid single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) logic has garnered considerable
  attention as a prospective technology for future computing systems, thanks to its
  superior high-speed and low-power characteristics. However, conventional semiconductor
  logic synthesis tools can not guarantee the functional correctness of the generated
  RSFQ circuits. RSFQ circuits require DFF and splitter insertion to satisfy the path
  balancing requirement and the fanout limitation, thereby legitimizing the circuit
  design. Furthermore, DFFs and splitters inserted in RSFQ circuits introduce delays,
  occupy area, and substantially increase energy dissipation. To address this problem,
  this paper proposes an optimal DFF-oriented technology legalization algorithm. First,
  an integer linear programming algorithm is proposed for the logic level assignment
  to minimize the number of inserted DFFs. Then a splitter tree is constructed for
  each net of the circuit to minimize the timing discrepancies among the various fanouts.
  The experimental results on ISCASâ€™85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
  and efficiency of our proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art, particularly
  with significant advantages on large circuits.
