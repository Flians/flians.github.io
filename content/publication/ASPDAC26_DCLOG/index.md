abstract: Logic rewriting serves as a robust optimization technique that enhances
  Boolean networks by substituting small segments with more effective implementations.
  The incorporation of don't cares in this process often yields superior optimization
  results. Nevertheless, the calculation of don't cares within a Boolean network can
  be resource-intensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective strategies
  that mitigate the computational costs associated with don't cares while simultaneously
  facilitating the exploration of improved optimization outcomes. To address these
  challenges, this paper proposes DCLOG, a don't cares-based logic optimization framework,
  to efficiently and effectively optimize a given Boolean network. DCLOG leverages
  a pre-trained graph neural network model to filter out cuts without don't cares
  and then performs an incremental window simulation to calculate don't cares for
  each cut. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DCLOG
  on large Boolean networks, specifically average size reductions of 15.64% and 1.44%
  while requiring less than 23.84% and 44.70% of the average runtime compared with
  state-of-the-art methods for the majority-inverter graph (MIG), respectively.
